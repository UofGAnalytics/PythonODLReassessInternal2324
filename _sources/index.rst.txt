Welcome to reassesslib's documentation!
===================================


Welcome to the Glasgow ODL reassessment Library for 2023. This library has been
designed to help you to write your assessment, consisting of several functions
and classes. It is simpler than a standard python package, but should
be a reasonable approximation of using an arbitrary package, something that is
often done in python. 

If the question specifies that you use library functions please use
make sure to use the appropriate functions from this library, and please do not
reimplement the methods in your own code. 

We have split this documentation into a few sections, but the most important is
the installation section that will show you how to install this library in your
own environment and the API section which will explain the arguments and
outputs of each of the functions and classes. Please make sure to check API
carefully to understand the input and output of each function.
